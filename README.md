> Welcome to Raptor! This little application that I built makes a raptor roar and move accross the screen when the button is clicked on. I used a jquery plugin, jquery libary, a mp3 file, css file to style the background and button. Some challenges I faced was getting the jquery plugin and libary and mp3 to all work together and since this project was built before I attented Flatiron School the CSS part was hard for me. In the future I would like to add the ability to decided between different dinosaurs and change to different backgrounds.
